This application is made using android recyclerview and volley to fetch all the JSON data from the iTunes API. 
The architecture used in this application is somewhat a MVP architecture model. I am still learning the difference between different architecture so I still can't really explain the different between them.
The app works with recyclerview which is highly customizable.
